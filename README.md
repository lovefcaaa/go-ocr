_The project is based on older versions of `tesseract` and other tools, and is now superseded by 
[another project](https://github.com/maxim2266/OCR)
which allows for more granular control over the text recognition process._

# go-ocr
A tool for extracting plain text from scanned documents (`pdf` or `djvu`), with user-defined postprocessing.

### Motivation
Once I had a task of OCR'ing a number of scanned documents in `pdf` format. I quickly built a pipeline
of the tools to extract images from the input files and to convert them to plain text, but then I realised that
modern OCR
software is still less than ideal in terms of recognising text, so a good deal of postprocessing was needed
in order to remove at least some of those OCR artefacts and irregularities. I ended up with a long pipeline
of `sed`/`grep` filters which
also had to be adjusted per each document and per each document language. What I wanted was a tool that could
combine the OCR tools invocation with filters application, also giving an easy way of modifying and combining
the filter definitions.

### The tool
Given an input file in either `pdf` or `djvu` format, the tool performs the following steps:

1. Images get extracted from the input file using `pdfimages` or `ddjvu` tool;
2. The extracted images get converted to plain text using `tesseract` tool, in parallel;
3. The specified filters get applied to the text.

### Invocation
```go-ocr [OPTION]... FILE```

Command line options:
```
-f,--first N        first page number (optional, default: 1)
-l,--last  N        last page number (optional, default: last page of the document)
-F,--filter FILE    filter specification file name (optional, may be given multiple times)
-L,--language LANG  document language (optional, default: 'eng')
-o,--output FILE    output file name (optional, default: stdout)
-h,--help           display this help and exit
-v,--version        output version information and exit
```

##### Example
The following command processes a document `some.pdf` in Russian, from page 12 to page 26 (inclusive),
without any postprocessing, storing the result in the file `document.txt`:
```
./go-ocr --first 12 --last 26 --language rus --output document.txt some.pdf
```

### Filter definitions
Filter definition file is a plain text file containing rewriting rules and C-style comments.
Each rewriting rule has the following format:
```
scope type "match" "substitution"
```
where
- `scope` is either `line` or `text`;
- `type` is either `word` or `regex`;
- `match` and `substitution` are Go strings.

Each rule must be on one line.

Each rule of the scope `line` is applied to each line of the text. There is no
processing done to the line by the tool itself other than trimming the trailing whitespace, which means
that a line does not have a trailing newline symbol when the rule is applied. After that all the lines get
combined into text with newline symbols inserted between them.

Each rule of the scope `text` is applied to the whole text after all the `line` rules. All newline
symbols are visible to the rule which allows for combining multiple lines into one.

The reason for having two different scopes for the rules is that applying a rule to a line is computationally
cheaper that applying to the whole text. Also, this makes the line regular expressions a bit simpler as,
for example, `\s` regex cannot match a newline.

Rules of type `word` do a simple substitution replacing any `match` string with its corresponding
`substitution` string.

Rules of type `regex` search the input for any match of the `match` regular expression and replace
it with the `substitution` string. The [syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) of the regular
expression is that of the Go `regexp` engine. The `substuitution` string may contain
[references](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.Expand) to the content of capturing groups
from the corresponding `match` regular expression. From the Go documentation, each reference

> is denoted by a substring of the form $name or ${name}, where name is a non-empty sequence of letters, digits, and underscores. A purely numeric name like $1 refers to the submatch with the corresponding index; other names refer to capturing parentheses named with the (?P\<name\>...) syntax. A reference to an out of range or unmatched index or a name that is not present in the regular expression is replaced with an empty slice.

> In the $name form, name is taken to be as long as possible: $1x is equivalent to ${1x}, not ${1}x, and, $10 is equivalent to ${10}, not ${1}0.

> To insert a literal $ in the output, use $$ in the template.

All filter definition files are always processed in the order in which they are specified on the command line.
Within each file, the rules are grouped by the `scope`, and applied in the order of specification. This
allows for each rule to rely on the outcome of all the rules before it.

##### Rewriting rules examples
Rule to replace ellipsis with a single utf-8 symbol:
```
line word	"..."  "â€¦"
```
Rule to replace all whitespace sequences with a single space character:
```
line regex	`\s+`	" "
```
Rule to remove all newline characters from the middle of a sentence:
```
text regex	`([a-z\(\),])\n+([a-z\(\)])` "${1} ${2}"
```

More examples can be found in the files `filter-eng` and `filter-rus`.

In practice, it is often useful to maintain
one filter definition file with rules to remove common OCR artefacts, and another file with rules
specific to a particular document. In general, it is probably impossible to avoid all manual editing
altogether by using this tool, but from my experience, a few hours spent on setting up the appropriate filters
for a 700 pages document can dramatically reduce the amount of manual work needed afterwards.

### Other tools
Internally the program relies on `pdfimages` and `ddjvu` tools for extracting images from the input file,
and on `tesseract` program for the actual OCR'ing. The tool `pdfimages` is usually a part of `poppler-utils`
package, the tool `ddjvu` comes from `djvulibre-bin` package, and `tesseract` is included in `tesseract-ocr`
package. By default, `tesseract` comes with the English language support only, other languages
should be installed separately, for example, run `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-rus`
to install the Russian language support. To find out what languages are currently installed type
`tesseract --list-langs`.

### Compilation
Invoke `make` (or `make debug`) from the directory of the project to compile the code with debug
information included, or `make release` to compile without debug symbols. This creates executable file `go-ocr`.

### Technical details
The tool first runs `pdfimages` or `ddjvu` program to extract images to a temporary directory, and then invokes
`tesseract` on each image in parallel to produce lines of plain text. Those lines are then passed through
the `line` filters, if any, then assembled into one text string and passed through `text` filters, if any.
`regexp` filters are implemented using [Regexp.ReplaceAll()](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/#Regexp.ReplaceAll)
function, and `word` filters are invocations of [bytes.Replace()](https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Replace) function.

### Known issues
Older versions of `pdfimages` tool do not have `-tiff` option, resulting in an error.

### Platform
Linux (tested on Linux Mint 18 64bit, based on Ubuntu 16.04), will probably work on MacOS as well.

Tools:
```bash
$ go version
go version go1.6.2 linux/amd64
$ tesseract --version
tesseract 3.04.01
...
$ pdfimages --version
pdfimages version 0.41.0
...
$ ddjvu --help
